# Assignment Submitter

Make an API that allows you to submit assignments to Canvas!

### Requirements

You need to at least have these routes (routes are the "/courses/{course_id}" part of the @app.get line):

- /courses
- /courses/{course_id}/assignments
- /courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/submit

Note: course_id and assignment_id do not need to have these same names.
